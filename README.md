Text classification Project- Movie review classification using Naïve Bayes and Linear SVC.
A dataset of 2k labeled entries has been used to train model which is giving accuray of 76.4% and 84.6% for Naïve Bayes and Linear SVC respectively.
To improve the accuracy more data points 6K has been fed to the model.
Steps taken-
Data load
Data Cleaning
Spliting the data into test and train
Training the model
Computing the accuracy.
Finally accuracy of 87.6% and 91% has been achieved for Naïve Bayes and Linear SVC model.
